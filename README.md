Browser version of [9003's gotIssues](https://github.com/jmikk/gotIssues), the next step in my endless quest to make gotIssues easier to run for non-technical users. It additionally generates rules for both container and nation for the [Containerise](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/containerise/) firefox addon.

Below from and still needed from [9003's repo](https://github.com/jmikk/gotIssues)

You will need the following Tampermonkey scripts now they are all located here (if you have old versions of these scripts please disable them) NsIssueCompactorRand.js autoclose=1.user.js

# DISCLAIMER

TL;DR: READ THIS, read the rules ask for help if you need help understanding scripts,

YOU A HUMAN MUST PUSH A BUTTON TO DO AN EVENT.

All scripts used for Nationstates should be used at the users own risk. Even the most legal of scripts can be run improperly and thus become illegal. Please make sure you read any code that you use or put your nation's name into as a user agent. Do not use any code that was given to you by people you do not know or trust even if it is created by someone you know. If you do not know how to read code talk with the developer of the code to make sure that you understand what the code is doing it is your responsibility to abide by scripting rules. And you should read them they are located here (https://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?p=16394966#p16394966).

With many farming scripts it is important to remember you need to press the key yourself to trigger all events this means you can not just hold the button down. You also can not put a rock or other object on the key to press the button for you.
